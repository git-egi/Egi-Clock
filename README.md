# Egi-Clock
Digital Clock Programmed using Java

Version 1.0
- Clock has two modes RGB Fade Effect, Static Mode ( Mode can be switched by uncommenting/commenting the according parts )
- Uses OS clock in order to work, maybe it could be done using an API ( Just an idea )

Future :
- Maybe add the ability to change timezone
- Add a stop watch tab
- Color and Font Menu
- Adjustable dimensions
- Ability to load your own backround
